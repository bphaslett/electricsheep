License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\par
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\par
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\par
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\par
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\par
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\par
 your programs, too.\par
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\par
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\par
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\par
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\par
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\par
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\par
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\par
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\par
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\par
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\par
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\par
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\par
 rights.\par
 .
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\par
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\par
 distribute and/or modify the software.\par
 .
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\par
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\par
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\par
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\par
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\par
 authors' reputations.\par
 .
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\par
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\par
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\par
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\par
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\par
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
 modification follow.\par
 .
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
 .
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\par
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\par
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\par
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\par
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\par
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\par
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\par
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\par
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\par
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\par
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\par
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\par
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\par
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\par
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\par
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\par
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\par
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\par
 along with the Program.\par
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\par
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\par
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\par
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
 .
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\par
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
 .
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\par
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\par
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\par
 parties under the terms of this License.\par
 .
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\par
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\par
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\par
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\par
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\par
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\par
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\par
 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\par
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\par
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\par
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\par
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
 collective works based on the Program.\par
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\par
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\par
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
 the scope of this License.\par
 .
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\par
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\par
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\par
 .
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\par
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\par
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
 .
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\par
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\par
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\par
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\par
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\par
 customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
 .
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\par
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\par
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\par
 received the program in object code or executable form with such\par
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\par
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\par
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\par
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\par
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\par
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include\par
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\par
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\par
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\par
 itself accompanies the executable.\par
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\par
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\par
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\par
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\par
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
 .
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\par
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\par
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\par
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\par
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\par
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\par
 parties remain in full compliance.\par
 .
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\par
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
 the Program or works based on it.\par
 .
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\par
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\par
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\par
 this License.\par
 .
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\par
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\par
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\par
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\par
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\par
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\par
 circumstances.\par
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\par
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
 impose that choice.\par
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
 .
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\par
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\par
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\par
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\par
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\par
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
 .
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\par
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\par
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\par
 address new problems or concerns.\par
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\par
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\par
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\par
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\par
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\par
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\par
 Foundation.\par
 .
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\par
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\par
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\par
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\par
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\par
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\par
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\par
 .
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\par
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\par
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\par
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\par
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\par
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\par
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\par
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\par
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
 .
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\par
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\par
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\par
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\par
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\par
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\par
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\par
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\par
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
 .
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\par
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
 .
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\par
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\par
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
 .
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
 .
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\par
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\par
 (at your option) any later version.\par
 .
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\par
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\par
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\par
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\par
 when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
 .
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\par
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\par
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\par
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\par
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\par
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\par
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\par
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\par
 .

 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\par
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\par
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\par
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\par
 Public License instead of this License.\par

 - Big fix / addition is to correctly return const values. TinyXml could basically
 remove const in a method like this: TiXmlElement* Foo() const, where the returned element
 was a pointer to internal data. That is now: const TiXmlElement* Foo() const and
 TiXmlElement* Foo().
 .
 2.3.4
 - Fixed additional const errors, thanks Kent Gibson.
 - Correctly re-enable warnings after tinyxml header. Thanks Cory Nelson.
 - Variety of type cleanup and warning fixes. Thanks Warren Stevens.
 - Cleaned up unneeded constructor calls in TinyString - thanks to Geoff Carlton and
 the discussion group on sourceforge.
 .
 2.4.0
 - Improved string class, thanks Tyge Lovset (whose name gets mangled in English - sorry)
 - Type cast compiler warning, thanks Rob van den Bogaard
 - Added GetText() convenience function. Thanks Ilya Parniuk & Andrew Ellers for input.
 - Many thanks to marlonism for finding an infinite loop in bad xml.
 - A patch to cleanup warnings from Robert Gebis.
 - Added ValueStr() to get the value of a node as a string.
 - TiXmlText can now parse and output as CDATA
 - Additional string improvement from James (z2895)
 - Removed extraneous 'const', thanks David Aldrich
 - First pass at switching to the "safe" stdlib functions. Many people have suggested and
 pushed on this, but Warren Stevens put together the first proposal.
 - TinyXml now will do EOL normalization before parsing, consistent with the W3C XML spec.
 - Documents loaded with the UTF-8 BOM will now save with the UTF-8 BOM. Good suggestion

 Script for automatically preparing the sources for compilation by
 performing the myrid of necessary steps.  The script attempts to
 detect proper version support, and outputs warnings about particular
 systems that have autotool peculiarities.
 .
 Basically, if everything is set up and installed correctly, the
 script will validate that minimum versions of the GNU Build System
 tools are installed, account for several common configuration
 issues, and then simply run autoreconf for you.
 .
 If autoreconf fails, which can happen for many valid configurations,
 this script proceeds to run manual preparation steps effectively
 providing a POSIX shell script (mostly complete) reimplementation of
 autoreconf.
